## Provably correct merge sort

* Order.idr — what an ordering function is? (boolean blindness, I know, but I couldn't come up with a more useful type)
* OrderedList.idr — what does it mean for a list to be ordered?
* Perm.idr — what does it mean for one list to be a permutation of another?
* Sorted.idr — what does it mean for one list to be a sorted version of another one? Hint: closely related to the previous two files.
* Merge.idr — now we're finally getting to the algorithm (yay) and some proofs.
